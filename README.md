Project Description
This project provides a foundational setup for a minimal e-commerce front-end. The index.html serves as a landing page displaying two sample products with "Buy Now" buttons. Clicking these buttons would hypothetically lead to a purchase process, culminating in the thank-you.html page, which confirms the transaction and provides order details.

Features
Responsive Design: Both pages are designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Tailwind CSS.

Product Display: The landing page (index.html) showcases two products with images, titles, descriptions, and prices.

Clear Call to Action: Prominent "Buy Now" buttons lead to a simulated transaction completion.

Transaction Confirmation: The thank you page (thank-you.html) provides a success message, a visual confirmation icon, and placeholder order details.

Navigation: Buttons on the thank you page allow users to continue shopping or view their order history.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web content.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling and responsive design.

Inter Font: A modern and highly readable typeface for improved aesthetics.

SVG Icons: Used for the success icon on the thank you page, ensuring scalability and crisp display.

Files Included
index.html: The main landing page displaying the products.

thank-you.html: The page displayed after a successful transaction.

How to Use
To view these pages:

Save the files: Save index.html and thank-you.html into the same folder on your computer.

Open in Browser: Simply open index.html in your web browser.

Simulate Transaction: Click on any "Buy Now" button on index.html. This will redirect you to thank-you.html.

Future Improvements
Dynamic Content: Implement JavaScript to dynamically load product data on index.html and populate order details on thank-you.html from a backend.

Product Detail Page: Create a product-detail.html page that displays more in-depth information for each specific product when its "Buy Now" button is clicked.

Actual Payment Gateway Integration: Connect the "Buy Now" button to a real payment processing flow.

User Authentication: Add user login/registration and personalize the experience.

Shopping Cart: Implement a shopping cart functionality to add multiple items before checkout.

Improved Navigation: Add a navigation bar to the landing page.

Error Handling: Implement pages for "page not found" (404) or transaction failures.
